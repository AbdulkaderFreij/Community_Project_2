      Whatever your hiking desires, there are always new adventures calling your name. I totally understand the dream of seeing distinguished sights and finding the most remote places. However, keep in mind that every step and choice you make will
      impact the environment around you. So, here are the best ways to show a little extra love to the environment while taking on a hiking adventure.
    </p>
    <div class="items">

        <h5>BRING A REUSABLE WATER BOTTLE</h5>
        <p class="hike-steps">
          Water is so important to have with you on any hike. Make sure you’ve planned ahead of time to bring your reusable bottle along. Our plastic bottle consumption has taken over our oceans and landfills. This is so disheartening when we can see
          how simple and easy it is to bring along your own.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h5>THINK LOCAL</h5>
        <p class="hike-steps">Fuel consumed by any mode of transportation, whether a car, plane, or train, can add a lot of emissions to the environment. Choose a local hike to explore, or carpool with friends if you want to go a little further. By
          opting out of major travel for your excursions, you will understand more of your local landscape while saving our atmosphere.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h5>BRING YOUR OWN SNACKS AND REFUEL LOCAL</h5>
        <p class="hike-steps">Making your own trail mix or granola will be better for your budget as well as the environment. By planning ahead, you can use ingredients that haven’t traveled far from their source. You will also be avoiding excessive
          packaging that so often accompanies snacks purchased from gas stations and such. Finally, pick a local restaurant after your hike. Rather than fast food, choose a business that puts sustainable food and products first.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h5>TAKE ONLY PICTURES, AND LEAVE ONLY MEMORIES</h5>
        <p class="hike-steps">Perhaps the most well-known wilderness rule is to Leave No Trace. This means that no one should be able to know you were out in the woods. Whatever you brought in, you need to bring out. This protects the rustic and
          natural feel of the woods. Beyond simply this, however, to truly love the environment, leave the place cleaner than you found it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h5>PROTECT OUR WATER</h5>
        <p class="hike-steps">Water is one of the most used resources that we take for granted. In order to preserve our natural waterways and the current balance, we must defend our streams, lakes, and oceans. There are a few ways we can keep the
          water clean. One of the most important rules is to dig cat holes and relieve yourself over two hundred feet away from any water source. On top of that, do not wash dishes close to the water. Instead, choose a biodegradable soap and wash
          with some of your personal water further away. By respecting the beauty of the natural water in these ways, we can share a little extra love with our aquatic friends.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h5>KEEP FIRES SMALL</h5>
        <p class="hike-steps">Fire can be one of the most dangerous things while camping or hiking. While it is enjoyable to roast marshmallows over a fire, make sure to keep it small and in a designated space. A fire without a border can quickly
          spread with only a spark. In addition, a fire without a healthy bed of dirt and ash underneath can start a root fire. This can burn for months without showing signs above ground and wreak havoc on the native tree and plant structures.
          Please make sure you always check fire regulations to see if you if there are bans or restrictions.</p>
